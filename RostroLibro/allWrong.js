/*
There's a multiple-choice test with N questions, numbered from 1 to N. Each question has 2 answer options, 
labelled A and B. You know that the correct answer for the ith question is the ith character in the string C, 
which is either "A" or "B", but you want to get a score of 0
on this test by answering every question incorrectly.
